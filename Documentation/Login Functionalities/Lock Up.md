Examples

Gmail/Google: Typically locks for a short period after 5 failed attempts.
Facebook: Temporary lockout often occurs after 5–10 failed attempts, sometimes requiring ID verification if suspicious.
Microsoft: Account lockout after 5–10 failed attempts, with increasing delays.
Instagram: Similar to Facebook (as it is owned by Meta), with 5 or more attempts triggering temporary lock or a CAPTCHA.
Banks: Often stricter, 3–5 failed attempts before temporary or even permanent lockout until manual recovery.

Examples of famous websites with this functionality:

Google (Gmail): If you enter the wrong password too many times, Google may temporarily lock your account from further login attempts. You may see a message saying "Too many failed attempts. Try again later."
Facebook: After multiple incorrect login attempts, Facebook will lock your account for a short period, requiring you to wait before trying again or go through additional verification steps.
Microsoft (Outlook, Office 365): Microsoft will temporarily lock accounts after several failed login attempts to protect against unauthorized access.
Twitter: Twitter also uses account lockout/timed lockout for repeated failed login attempts.
Banking websites: Almost all online banking platforms have similar lockout mechanisms for security.
