**Why do we use both `is_active = TRUE` and `is_revoked = FALSE` as separate fields for refresh token management?**
---

## 1. **Separation of Concerns / Semantic Clarity**

- **`is_active`**:  
  Represents whether a token is currently valid for use (not expired and not revoked).  
- **`is_revoked`**:  
  Represents whether the token has been explicitly revoked by user action (e.g., logout, "logout all devices", admin action, security incident).

By separating these, you make your business logic much clearer and more flexible.  
For example:  
- A token may become **inactive** due to expiry, without ever being revoked.  
- A token may be **revoked** (explicit action) before it expires or even after it expires.

---

## 2. **Auditing and Security**

- **Tracking Revocation:**  
  You can record **why** a token is no longer usable. If `is_active = FALSE` and `is_revoked = TRUE`, you know it was due to revocation (not expiry).
- **Incident Response:**  
  Suppose a user reports suspicious activity. You can check if a token was **revoked** (user action) vs. simply **expired** (natural lifecycle).

---

## 3. **More Flexible Query Logic**

- If you want to find all currently usable tokens, you check `is_active = TRUE AND is_revoked = FALSE AND expires_at > now()`.
- If you want to list all tokens a user has ever revoked (for a "security history" page), you check `is_revoked = TRUE`, regardless of `is_active`.
- If a token is expired, you might set `is_active = FALSE` but keep `is_revoked = FALSE` (not revoked, just expired).

---

## 4. **Future-proofing and Business Rules**

- You might have a business rule where tokens can be **disabled** by the system (e.g., after a password change or admin action) without revoking them.
- You may want to **reactivate** a token (set `is_active = TRUE`) for special cases, but never un-revoke (`is_revoked` stays `TRUE`).

## 5. **Practical Example Table**

| Scenario                       | is_active | is_revoked | expires_at > now() | Usable? | Notes                            |
|-------------------------------|-----------|------------|--------------------|---------|----------------------------------|
| Fresh token                   |   TRUE    |   FALSE    |       TRUE         |  Yes    | Normal, usable token             |
| Expired token                 |   FALSE   |   FALSE    |       FALSE        |  No     | Naturally expired                |
| Revoked by user               |   FALSE   |   TRUE     |       TRUE/False   |  No     | Explicit logout/revocation       |
| Revoked after expiry          |   FALSE   |   TRUE     |       FALSE        |  No     | For audit/history                |
| Disabled for security reasons |   FALSE   |   FALSE    |       TRUE         |  No     | System deactivation, not revoked |

---

## **Summary**

- **`is_active`** is used for "can this token be used right now?" logic.
- **`is_revoked`** is for "was this token explicitly revoked?" (auditing/history).
- Keeping them separate allows for **clearer, safer, and more maintainable** business logic, better auditing, and easier debugging/security review.
